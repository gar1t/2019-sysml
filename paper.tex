\begin{abstract}

  We present Guild AI, an open source toolkit that facilitates model
  reuse for application development by applying traditional software
  packaging constructs to the domain of machine learning. Package
  management strategies are central to successful software
  ecosystems. Examples include \href{https://www.npmjs.com/}{npm} for
  JavaScript, \href{https://wiki.debian.org/Apt}{APT} for Debian, and
  \href{https://pip.pypa.io}{pip} for Python. While such tools excel
  at creating traditional software packages, machine learning
  applications present unique requirements that call for
  specialization. Guild AI combines the proven effectiveness of
  package managers with novel features to enable machine learning
  model reuse for application development across a variety of use
  cases.

\section{Introduction}

TODO:

- What problem is being solved?

- How package managers facilitate code reuse

\subsection{Related Work}

- How machine learning models are distributed today (pip, GitHub
projects)

- Frameworks and libraries

- TensorFlow Hub

- Keras Applications

- ???

\subsection{Differences}

- How is Guild different from these cited projects?

- Include model and operation definitions

- Reuse through distribution and patching

- Federation (protocol driven, intelligence moved to the perimeter).

You can copy the file by running \verb|cp foo bar| where \textit{foo}
is some file you want to copy and \textit{bar} is something else.

I will \textbf{make this bold} yo.

\subsection{Teletype}

Set the value to \texttt{accepted} and everything will be okay.

\subsection{Footnotes}

You can use footnotes\footnote{Footnotes should be complete
  sentences.} which will be super awesome. Don't ask me how it works.
